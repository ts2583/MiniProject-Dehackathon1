    This is a bit interesting, we want to be able

    this I really don't have a concise understanding but we can hack something
    and ask for advice for people who understand flask.

    But basically here we should have a page that is able to
    add new books, this is really easy to do just create
    a layout for the admin to do that, however in order for him
    to delete books we need to showcase a list of books he can
