# MiniProject-Dehackathon1
Tech Stack:
Backend: Flask/Python (3.7)
Data/Database: SQL/sqlite will move to postgress
Frontend: React/JS

Piping Flask && Data?
SqlAlchemy works well

Piping Flask && ReactJS?
unsure yet but I believe Axios in react or something
similar will work.

# packages to setup backend:
all can be installed via pip
Flask, Flask Marshmellow, Flask Sqlchemy

# to run:
run on debug "python coffeeshop.py" on directory folder
or setup paths:

Windows:
 set FLASK_APP=coffeeshop.py
 set FLASK_ENV=development
 
Linux:
  export FLASK_APP=coffeeshop.py
  export FLASK_ENV=development
